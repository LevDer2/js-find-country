# Find a Country

A small web application that lets you search for a country and view basic information about it.

## Features

- Search for a country by its full name or part of the name (for example: `usa`, `sp`).
- See a list of matching countries if only part of the name is entered.
- View key information about the selected country:
  - official name
  - capital
  - population
  - official languages
  - flag image
- Error handling if a country cannot be found.

The interface is kept simple and clean: the search bar with a button is at the top of the page, and the results appear below as either a detailed country card or a list of matches.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – page structure
- **CSS3** – styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript** – search logic and data rendering
- **REST Countries API** – source of country data (name, capital, languages, population, flag)

## How to Use

1. Open the site using this link:
